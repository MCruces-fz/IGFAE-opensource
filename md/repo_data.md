# IGFAE Open Source Repositories

Visibility of opensource initiatives of the IGFAE.

- [next-ext](https://github.com/next-exp): Several opensource projects from the NEXT experiment. Here is the [webpage](https://next.ific.uv.es/next/). Featured repositories:
    + [IC](https://github.com/next-exp/IC). IC cities are scripts that read data from "persistent storage" (e.g, from disk), then (eventually) filter it and finally create some new data that is written in PS.
    + [Nexus](https://github.com/next-exp/IC/nexus). NEXT Utility for Simulation.
- [tofpet3d](https://github.com/jerenner/tofpet3d): 3D PET reconstruction code.
- [TrasgoGroup](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup): Simulation, analysis, monitoring and documentation for Trasgo Group. Featured repositories:
    + [EnsarRoot](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup/EnsarRoot): EnsarRoot, the framework for simulation and data analysis for ENSAR.
    + [TRUFA](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup/TRUFA): Unpacking and tracking code for Tragaldabas (TRasgo User-friendly Framework for Analysis).
    + [Cell-Viewer](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup/Cell-Viewer): Graphical User Interface to monitor data from TRASGO type detectors. Cell-Viewer generates cellmaps reading unpacked data from Tragaldabas.
- [Héctor Álvarez Pol](https://github.com/hapol):  Univ. de Santiago de Compostela, Dpto. Física de Partículas.
    + [hapol/ATTPCROOTv2](https://github.com/hapol/ATTPCROOTv2) (Fork from [ATTPC/ATTPCROOTv2](https://github.com/ATTPC/ATTPCROOTv2)): ATTPCROOT is a ROOT-based (root.cern.ch) framework to analyze data of the ATTPC detector (Active Target Time Projection Chamber) and the p-ATTPC (Prototype).
    + [hapol/sofia](https://github.com/hapol/sofia) (Fork from [R3BRootGroup/sofia](https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia)): Software for the SOFIA experiment. The R3BRoot software is based on the FairRoot framework and can be used to perform Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data analysis of the R3B (Reactions with Relativistic Radioactive Beams) nuclear physics experiments at the FAIR research center (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research).
    + [hapol/Actarsim](https://github.com/hapol/Actarsim) (Fork from [ActarSimGroup/Actarsim](https://github.com/ActarSimGroup/Actarsim)): ACTARSim is a simulation package developed to determine the response of the ACTAR-TPC Active Target and other similar Active Target projects, as well as their ancillary detectors. It uses Geant4 to track the beam and the reaction particles, and a ROOT-based code for the description of the electrons in the Active Target gas and the response of the detector after the electrons drift and diffusion. This software combination allows a versatile and modular configuration of different detector geometries, description of gas mixtures and pad plane detection methods of different shapes and sizes.
