    + [Nexus](https://github.com/next-exp/IC/nexus). NEXT Utility for Simulation.
- [tofpet3d](https://github.com/jerenner/tofpet3d): 3D PET reconstruction code.
- [TrasgoGroup](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup): Simulation, analysis, monitoring and documentation for Trasgo Group. Featured repositories:
    + [EnsarRoot](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup/EnsarRoot): EnsarRoot, the framework for simulation and data analysis for ENSAR.
    + [TRUFA](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup/TRUFA): Unpacking and tracking code for Tragaldabas (TRasgo User-friendly Framework for Analysis).
    + [Cell-Viewer](https://github.com/TrasgoGroup/Cell-Viewer): Graphical User Interface to monitor data from TRASGO type detectors. Cell-Viewer generates cellmaps reading unpacked data from Tragaldabas.
